## Future Work

Building upon the current implementation, several improvements and extensions could be made to enhance both functionality and usability of the system:

---

### User Authentication and Management

- **Implementation of a multi-user authentication system**, allowing:
  - Association of collected data with individual user profiles.
  - Clear separation between sessions conducted by different users.
  - Secure access and improved scalability of the application in collaborative research environments.

---

### Machine Learning Integration

- **Development of predictive models** using physiological signals, with emphasis on:
  - **Anomaly detection**, to identify irregular physiological patterns in real time.
  - Automated tagging and classification of signal events based on learned behavior.
  - Deeper integration of existing models into the streaming pipeline.

---

### Interface Optimization

- **Improvement of the front-end UI/UX**, particularly:
  - Greater **customization of visualizations** (e.g., sensor selection, time windows).
  - Enhanced **accessibility** for users with different technical backgrounds.
  - More intuitive layout for session management and data interpretation.

---

### Data Export Capabilities

- **Implementation of data export features**, allowing researchers to download collected data in widely used formats such as:
  - `.csv` for spreadsheet and statistical software compatibility.
  - `.mat` for integration with **MATLAB** and signal processing workflows.
