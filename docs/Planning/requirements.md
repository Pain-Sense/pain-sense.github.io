# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Based on the requirements gathered during the analysis phase, the system must provide the following key features:

1. **Real-Time Data Reception, Storage, and Processing**  
   The system should handle continuous real-time data streams from multiple sensors, storing and processing them efficiently with low latency to ensure reliable operation.

2. **Data Visualization and Anomaly Alerts**  
   Collected data must be displayed clearly via graphs or tables for easy monitoring. The system should include automatic anomaly detection algorithms to identify irregularities (like missing data) and send timely alerts.

3. **Temporal Data Consistency**  
   Time-series data must be processed to ensure accuracy and integrity, enabling pattern recognition over time.

4. **Integration of Multiple Data Sources**  
   Support integration of data from different sensor types.

5. **Protection of Biometric Data**  
   Sensitive biometric data must be securely stored and transmitted, encrypted both in transit and at rest. The system must comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA to protect patient information.

6. **Real-Time Diagnostic Support**  
   Processed data should be available in real time to assist diagnosis, including integration with machine learning models that provide predictions or recommendations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **High Scalability**  
  The system must scale horizontally to support a growing number of sensors and users without performance loss, accommodating future expansion.

- **Security and Privacy**  
  Robust security measures must protect system integrity and data confidentiality.

- **High Availability and Reliability**  
  The system should ensure continuous, reliable operation with minimal downtime, even during maintenance or peak loads. It must perform consistently with low failure rates.

- **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**  
  The system should tolerate component failures (sensors, servers, or network) and include automatic recovery strategies to minimize downtime and data loss.
