  # Architecture

## System Architecture

The system architecture was designed based on the gathered requirements and consists of four main modules:

1. **Data Generation:**  
   Simulates IoT devices and connects to a real ESP32 device.

2. **Real-Time Analysis:**  
   Receives MQTT messages and visualizes the collected data in real time.

3. **Data Processing:**  
   Acts as an intermediary to handle messages, performing noise reduction, feature extraction, and event detection.

4. **Processed Data:**  
   Stores processed information and makes it available for visualization.

### Simplified Data Flow

Once the ESP32 device is configured, it sends MQTT messages to the broker. These messages are consumed by two main components:  
- **Grafana**, which uses the data for real-time visualization.  
- **Processing system**, which receives data via Kafka.

In the processing system, Python scripts perform feature extraction. The extracted features are sent to a second Kafka topic and then stored in an InfluxDB database. Both raw and processed data are saved in this database and can be viewed in Grafanaâ€™s frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **MQTT:** A lightweight protocol for real-time communication between IoT devices, used to transmit physiological sensor data.  
- **Grafana:** A real-time visualization tool for monitoring physiological signals through customizable dashboards.  
- **InfluxDB:** A time-series database chosen to store physiological data with accurate timestamps.  
- **MySQL:** A relational database for structured data like patient information and experiment details.  
- **Telegraf:** Bridges Kafka and InfluxDB, automatically sending processed data to the database.  
- **Apache Kafka:** A scalable data streaming platform that ensures ordered message delivery and fault tolerance.  
- **Python:** Used for writing scripts that process physiological signals, extracting key metrics like heart rate peaks.  
- **Quarkus (Java):** A lightweight framework for developing REST APIs; manages data, communicates with MySQL, and provides extra features like tagging processed messages.  
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Tools to create isolated containers for each system component, simplifying setup, testing, and deployment.  
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface for data visualization.
