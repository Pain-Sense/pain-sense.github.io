Dr. Ana Martins is a 52-year-old internist at a university hospital. She is an experienced and dedicated professional who actively integrates technology into her medical practice. With additional training in Digital Health and a strong involvement in clinical research, she continually seeks solutions to improve patient monitoring and treatment.

Despite advances in medical devices, Dr. Martins faces significant challenges: fragmented systems, lack of interoperability between platforms, and difficulty accessing historical clinical data efficiently. These issues affect both her daily clinical work and the research studies she conducts.

She sees the **Data-Driven Diagnostics** project as a concrete opportunity to address these problems. Having a reliable, scalable platform that integrates real-time physiological data with consistent historical records directly meets her needs as a physician and researcher.

### Dr. Ana Martinsâ€™ Goals

- Monitor patients more accurately with up-to-date, centralized physiological data.  
- Overcome technological fragmentation by integrating multiple sensors into one interoperable system.  
- Facilitate research by accessing structured and historically consistent data.
