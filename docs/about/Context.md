# Context

This project builds on a hardware prototype originally developed by a student from another major for pain research in the “Flexible Production Systems” course. The first version integrated IoT sensors with information systems using MQTT, but was limited to basic data display.

Building on that concept, a full reengineering effort was launched to address key limitations—such as lack of data synchronization, limited scalability, and no support for multiple devices or advanced analysis. The original system’s use of a traditional relational database also restricted performance and flexibility.

The new solution aims to create a modern, scalable, and reliable infrastructure for real-time processing and interpretation of physiological data, supporting future applications in clinical diagnostics, continuous monitoring, and biomedical sensor research.
