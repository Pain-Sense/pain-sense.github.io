# Objectives

The main goal of this project is to reengineer the original solution by developing a more complete, reliable, and extensible software and hardware infrastructure, ready to support future initiatives in data-driven physiological diagnostics.

The new system was designed to:

    Ensure temporal consistency of the collected data;

    Support multiple IoT devices operating simultaneously;

    Enable efficient processing of large volumes of physiological data;

    Facilitate advanced interpretation of physiological signals;

    Integrate diverse storage solutions, including time-series databases better suited to this domain.

This reengineering effort aims not only to enhance the systemâ€™s technical capabilities but also to establish a solid foundation for future applications in assisted diagnostics, clinical research, and remote patient monitoring.
