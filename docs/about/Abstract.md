The Data-Driven Diagnostics project aims to create a robust tech platform for integrating, visualizing, and analyzing data from physiological sensors. Developed in response to the growing interest in digital health, the system connects IoT devices to software that displays real-time and historical health data.

It supports multiple sensors, ensures accurate time records, and interprets complex signals. Beyond visualization, itâ€™s built to be scalable and ready for clinical research needs.
