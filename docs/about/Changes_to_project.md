# Project Changes

Throughout the development of this project, we faced several challenges—both technical and organizational—that significantly influenced its direction and outcome. Below are some of the key changes and difficulties we encountered:

- **Shift in project focus**:  
  The original plan was to extend a previous pain-related project by integrating existing hardware and applying machine learning to predict pain thresholds. However, following feedback from our project coordinator, the focus was broadened into a more general platform for real-time physiological sensor analysis. This shift required major adjustments to our technical roadmap.

- **Team reduction and collaboration issues**:  
  The project started with five members, but only two remain actively involved. The others were very difficult to work with throughout the process and ultimately decided to give up before the end. This lack of commitment and communication especially impacted the machine learning component, which remained incomplete due to its complexity and need for specialized collaboration.

Despite these obstacles, the project evolved into a functional and extensible platform that lays the groundwork for future data-driven diagnostic applications.
