# Project Changes

The project initially focused on the study of pain; however, following feedback from our coordinator, this focus was broadened into a more general real-time sensor analysis platform. Additionaly the original plan also included implementing machine learning for diagnostic purposes, this component was unfortunately not realized due to the withdrawal of some team members.
