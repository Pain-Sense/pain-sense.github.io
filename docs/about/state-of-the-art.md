# Context and State of The Art

### Project Context
- Lack of temporal consistency in data streams.
- Difficulty in handling large volumes of sensor data with existing tools.
- Inability to track and manage multiple devices efficiently.
- Limited support for real-time data analysis and interpretation.
- Privacy concerns with biometric data storage and transmission.

### State of The Art (SOA)
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Supports real-time streaming and processing of large volumes of sensor data from multiple devices.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Ensures temporal consistency in data streams for reliable analyses and time-series evaluations.
- **Advanced Data Interpretation**: Leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret physiological data accurately, enabling better diagnostic support.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Allows seamless integration of multiple devices and sensors, with support for both online and offline data streams.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Provides real-time alerts for anomalies or data gaps in the sensor data, enhancing system reliability.
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Implements robust mechanisms to protect biometric data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Efficient Storage & Querying**: Utilizes technologies like InfluxDB for efficient time-series data storage and retrospective analysis.
- **Modular & Resilient Architecture**: Ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability to handle increasing data volume and system complexity.
