# Requirements

## Functional Requirements:
1. **Real-Time Data Reception, Storage, and Processing**
   - The system must receive real-time data streams from multiple sensors, store the data efficiently, and process it with low latency. 
   - It should support continuous data collection.

2. **Data Visualization and Alerts in Case of Anomalies**
   - Data should be visualized in an intuitive format (graphs, tables, etc.) for easy monitoring.
   - The system must include automated anomaly detection algorithms to flag potential issues (e.g., out-of-range values, missing data) and send alerts to the appropriate users (e.g., doctors, nurses).

3. **Temporal Consistency of the Data**
   - Time-series data must be processed in a way that supports accurate retrospective analysis and pattern recognition.

4. **Multi-Source Data Integration**
   - The system should support the integration of data from various sources (different types of sensors).

5. **Biometric Data Protection**
   - Sensitive biometric data must be securely stored and transmitted, ensuring it is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
   - The system must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to protect patient information.
   
6. **Real-Time Diagnostic Support**
   - Processed data should be made available for real-time diagnostic support. This includes feeding data to machine learning models for predictions or recommendations regarding pain management and treatments.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **High Scalability**
   - The system should be able to scale horizontally to support a growing number of sensors and users without performance degradation. This is critical to accommodate future growth as more devices are added.
   - It should also scale vertically to handle increased data volume as the number of connected devices increases.

2. **Security and Privacy**
   - Robust security measures must be implemented to protect both the integrity of the system and the confidentiality of the data.

3. **High Availability and Reliability**
   - The system must be designed for high availability, ensuring continuous data collection and processing even in the event of hardware failures, network issues, or other disruptions.

4. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**
   - The system must be fault-tolerant, with the ability to continue processing and handling data in the face of errors or hardware malfunctions.

5. **Modular Architecture**
   - The system must be built with a modular architecture to support easy upgrades and integration of new sensors, data sources, and processing algorithms.
   - This flexibility allows for future-proofing and easier maintenance as technology evolves.

6. **Real-Time Data Analysis Capabilities**
   - The system should support advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms that provide actionable insights from real-time data streams.
   - The ability to analyze and visualize data in near real-time enables timely decisions and interventions for patient care.
